# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis of Dell Product Reviews using RoBERTa-Large

This project explores **sentiment analysis** using Dell product reviews collected from social platforms. The core goal was to **predict user sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)** using **state-of-the-art NLP models**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a highly accurate text classification model that can interpret user sentiments on Dell product reviews.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- âœ… **Model Used**: `RoBERTa-Large` (Pretrained transformer model)
- âœ… **Achieved Accuracy**: **99.1%** on test data
- âœ… Compared performance of traditional models (Logistic Regression) vs transformer-based models
- âœ… Fully preprocessed text using custom NLP pipeline

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing HTML tags, symbols, stopwords, and special characters
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Class balance, word clouds, and token patterns
3. **Model Training**:
   - Fine-tuned `roberta-large` using Hugging Face Transformers
   - Used GPU for faster training
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved **99.1% accuracy**
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
